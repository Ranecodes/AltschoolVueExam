# Altschool Third Semester Exam Submission

This is an app built with Vue. It fetches the Github API and displays a user's repositories.
It also contains a pagination feature and nested routes leading to a single repo card.

I designed this app myself using Figma.

For the typography I made use of DM Sans and Poppins.
